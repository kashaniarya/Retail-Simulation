# Retail-Simulation
In this project, we'll write a simulation.  Suppose that a chain of big-box retail stores is considering a rearrangement of the way that customers go through the check-out process, in hopes of processing customers more efficiently, helping them spend less time waiting in line, and keeping their business from being lost to more efficient competitors. To aid in that analysis, you'll build a program that will simulate two different arrangements of lines and registers, generating a log of the movement of customers throughout the simulation and, at the end, overall statistics.
